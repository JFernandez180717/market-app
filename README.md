### Railway

Bring your code, we'll handle the rest. Made for any language, for projects big and small. [Railway](https://railway.app/)
is the cloud that takes the complexity out of shipping software.

Create a new empty project in Railway and start by creating a PostgreSQL database. Once you have that created you can create
a new project from GitHub. You can use the following environment variables based on the database you just created.

```properties
spring_profiles_active=prod
PROD_DB_HOST=roundhouse.proxy.rlwy.net
PROD_DB_PORT=43010
PROD_DB_NAME=market-app
PROD_DB_PASSWORD=bgEBcddAfEe555CBFdd-G*D3Ef6-gA6c
PROD_DB_USERNAME=postgres
```
